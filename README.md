# [Advent of Code][aoc]

My solutions to the [Advent of Code (AoC)][aoc] challenges. My AoC account is linked to my [GitHub](https://github.com/ASTRELION), so there's a [mirror][mirror] of this repository there, too.

All inputs in this repository are the example inputs given in each day's challenge (or close to it), not the actual input used for submitting.
